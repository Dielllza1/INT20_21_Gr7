							<p>“Best Place"</p>
							<p>Our menu spotlights a seasonal selection of salads, vegetables, and homemade cake.</p>
							<p>Wine is paramount to the Food House experience, with a 550+ bottle-deep list, and upwards of 20 by-the-glass selections gracing the menu at all times. A parade of spirit-forward, expertly-crafted cocktails improve upon the watering
								holes of days gone by, as do an edited collection of tap and bottled beer.</p>
							<p>-Customer reviews- <br> <br>“Loved this Place” <br> We decided to check this place out this past weekend because it was near our hotel and had good reviews on this website. I loved it! It was 7:30 on a Saturday night, but we only had
								to wait a couple of minutes. The staff was friendly and attentive, and our waitress, Heidi, was a lot of fun to banter with. I started with the apple cinna-martini (I altered their recipe a little and asked for vodka instead of
								rum), and it was sooo good!</p>
							<p>And then the bread….. so warm that it was almost too hot to the touch – the butter just melted on it. My husband had the clam chowder which was delicious! He also had the eggplant parm which was just okay. But I had the scallop pizza
								with bacon, garlic, and spinach and it was fabulous! So the food, the staff, and the atmosphere was all very nice.</p>
							<p>I only wish I lived closer to this place so I could go again.</p>
